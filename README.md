This repository will contain each Undead Legacy localizations

## Localizations

Create a new directory in the root folder like this: `UndeadLegacy_Localization_LANGAUGE`

For example, assuming you want to translate to Spanish:

- Create a new folder named `UndeadLegacy_Localization_Spanish`
- Copy the content inside `UndeadLegacy_Localization_English` in `UndeadLegacy_Localization_Spanish`
- Edit `ModInfo.xml` replacing language and author
- Edit `Localization.txt`, the first line `Key,spanish` and translate the strings
- Commit your changes to your own [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
- Submit a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with your changes

It may take some time to review your submitted Pull Request. Try to involve a
few native speakers of the language you're translating to in the Pull Request
comments. They'll help review your translation for simple mistakes and give us
a better idea of whether your translation is accurate.
